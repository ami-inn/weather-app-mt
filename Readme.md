# Weather Dashboard â€“ Machine Round Task

## Overview
Design and build a responsive Weather Dashboard using **Figma** (UI/UX) and **Next.js** (development). The dashboard visualizes weather and soil metrics in a clean, modern, single-page layout.

- **No scrolling** on desktop (all data fits on one screen)
- **Auto-refreshes every 1 hour** (graphs update without page reload)
- Powered by a **free weather API** or **mocked static data**

---

## Features

- **Location Name** (e.g., "New York, USA")
- **Current Date** (e.g., "June 2, 2025")
- **Summary Box**:
    - Current temperature
    - Current rainfall
- **Graphs (last 7 days, daily data points):**
    - Temperature
    - Rainfall
    - Soil Temperature
    - Soil Moisture

---

## Data & Refresh

- Uses a free weather API (or static mocked data if unavailable)
- API/data **refreshes every 1 hour** (randomized static data on reload)
- **Graphs and UI update automatically** (no page reload)

---

## Design (Figma)

- Visually clean, modern, and easy to understand
- Component-based design (reusable blocks)
- [Figma Design Link](#) <!-- Replace with your Figma link -->

---

## Development (Next.js)

- Built with **Next.js**
- UI framework: _Tailwind CSS / Chakra UI / Material UI_ (choose one)
- Charting library: _Chart.js / Recharts / ApexCharts_ (choose one)
- Component-based architecture
- Environment variable support for APIs
- Well-commented, maintainable code
